# Monetization

This document outlines our strategy for increasing app traffic and achieving profitability.

A core principle is that individual users will not be charged for using the app.

## Path to Monetization

- [ ] Allow users to donate and support the app.
- [ ] Increase user traffic by scraping public sporting events from the web (temporary measure).
- [ ] Offer anonymized, non-sensitive insights (e.g., participant numbers, gender, age demographics) to interested companies.
- [ ] Partner with organizations that want to advertise their events (paid) through the app.
- [ ] Onboard initial health professionals to offer courses on the app.
- [ ] Engage with health insurance companies to secure support for the app.
- [ ] Enable health professionals to monetize their courses, initially by allowing users to pay with `bonus_points`.
- [ ] Provide users with the option to redeem `bonus_points` for health-improving products and services (e.g., gadgets, workouts, courses).

## Milestones and Key Actions

- [ ] First user on the app.
- [ ] Reach 1,000 users: Initiate outreach to companies interested in advertising their events on the app.
- [ ] Secure the first company advertisement.
- [ ] Reach 10,000 users: Begin outreach to health insurance companies.
- [ ] Onboard the first health insurance company to the app.
